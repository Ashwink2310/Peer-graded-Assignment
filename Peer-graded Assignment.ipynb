    "In the world of data science and programming, arithmetic expressions play a fundamental role in performing mathematical operations. These expressions allow you to work with numbers, variables, and mathematical operations to manipulate and analyze data. Let's explore some common arithmetic expressions you might encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addition (+)**: Addition is used to find the sum of two or more numbers. For example, `2 + 3` results in `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subtraction (-)**: Subtraction is used to find the difference between two numbers. For example, `5 - 2` results in `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplication is used to find the product of two or more numbers. For example, `4 * 3` results in `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Division (/)**: Division is used to find the quotient when one number is divided by another. For example, `10 / 2` results in `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exponentiation (**)**: Exponentiation is used to raise a number to a certain power. For example, `2 ** 3` results in `8` because it's 2 raised to the power of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Modulo (%)**: Modulo is used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, `10 % 3` results in `1` because when 10 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1.\n"
